# The Libraries Firehose

The Firehose is a streaming API that gives developers low latency access to Librariesâ€™ activity without the overhead associated with polling a REST endpoint.

Each event constitues the release of a package in one of the supported platforms.

It implements the [HTML5 Server-Sent Events / EventSource API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource).

Sample clients in the `examples` folder. And a running example [here](http://librariesio.github.io/firehose-stream/).

## Endpoint

`http://firehose.libraries.io/events`

Only the `http` is supported at the moment so if you connect from a secure page make sure to allow mixed content. CORS is supported.

## Event stream format

```
event: pkg
data: {"platform":"Packagist","name":"miniframe/miniframe","version":"1.0.x-dev"}
```

###

Example event pull request event (JSON):

```js
{
  "id": 25105,
  "title": "works as a slide deck (with both arrows and keyboard buttons + can expand to show all slides if needed",
  "issue_url": "https://github.com/ermlikeyeah/HMRC-Git-lessons/pull/2",
  "body": "\r\n\r\n#24pr @ladieswhocode",
  "state": "open",
  "merged": false,
  "created_at": "2015-12-05T15:49:50.000Z",
  "repo_name": "ermlikeyeah/HMRC-Git-lessons",
  "user_id": 10449,
  "comments_count": 0,
  "language": null,
  "user": {
    "uid": "8432520",
    "nickname": "techforevil",
    "name": null,
    "blog": null,
    "location": null
  }
}
```

From the standard:

> The event stream is a simple stream of text data, which must be encoded using UTF-8. Each message is separated by a pair of newline characters. A colon as the first character of a line is, in essence, a comment, and is ignored.
